## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive, hierarchical course website for a 6-week AI Engineering curriculum. Built as a static website optimized for GitHub Pages deployment with rich educational content and progressive course structure.

### Mission & Purpose
Transform traditional course materials into an interactive, navigable website featuring:
- **Hierarchical content organization** (Course → Weeks → Sessions → Topics)
- **Rich educational content** including lecture scripts, interactive elements, and instructor notes
- **Professional design** with Cyber Academic theme (dark mode with cyan/purple accents)
- **Mobile-responsive** design optimized for all devices
- **GitHub Pages ready** with zero external dependencies

### Target Content Structure
Expected markdown input files organized as:
```
/course-content/
  ├── week1.md - week6.md (course content by week)
  ├── course-overview.md (optional)
  └── resources.md (optional)
```

Each week's markdown should contain:
- Week title and overview
- Learning objectives
- Lecture details (title, topics, duration)
- Hands-on activities
- Project description and deliverables
- Resources and materials

## Quick Start & Development Commands

### Option 1: Local Development Server (Recommended)
```bash
cd ai-engineering-course
python3 run-local-server.py
# Opens http://localhost:8000 with cache-disabled headers for development
```

### Option 2: Simple Python Server
```bash
cd ai-engineering-course
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Opens http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 3: Direct File Access
Open `index.html` directly in browser (note: some features may not work due to CORS restrictions):
```
file:///path/to/ai-engineering-course/index.html
```

### Option 4: GitHub Pages Deployment
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Upload all files maintaining directory structure
3. Enable Pages in Settings > Pages
4. Select 'main' branch and '/ (root)' folder
5. Site will be live at: `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`

## Architecture & Code Structure

### Core Design System
- **Theme**: Cyber Academic (dark background with cyan/purple accents)
- **Typography**: Space Mono (display) + Inter Display (body)
- **Color Scheme**: CSS variables defined in `:root` of `assets/css/shared.css`
- **Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox, mobile-first responsive design

### Key File Locations
- **Main Hub**: `index.html` - Course overview and navigation
- **Shared Styles**: `assets/css/shared.css` - Unified CSS variables and components
- **Shared Scripts**: `assets/js/navigation.js` - Common JavaScript functionality
- **Week Content**: `weeks/week[N]/index.html` - Week overview pages
- **Session Hubs**: `weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/index.html` - Session overview with topic navigation
- **Topic Content**: `weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/topic[N].html` - Individual lesson pages
- **Project Pages**: `weeks/week[N]/project.html` - Project guides and deliverables
- **Source Content**: `course-content/` - Original markdown files

### Component System

#### CSS Classes for Content Structure
- `.content-section` - Main content containers
- `.lecture-section` - Individual lecture segments with timing
- `.instructor-script` - Speaking notes for instructors
- `.interactive-element` - Hands-on activities and discussion prompts

- Sticky navigation with backdrop blur effects

### Path Structure Conventions
- Relative paths from week content: `../../assets/css/shared.css`
- Relative paths from session index: `../../../assets/css/shared.css`
- Relative paths from topic content: `../../../../assets/css/shared.css`
- All paths relative to maintain GitHub Pages compatibility

### Navigation Hierarchy
The site follows a 4-level hierarchical structure:
1. **Course Level** (`index.html`) - Main course overview
2. **Week Level** (`weeks/week[N]/index.html`) - Week overview with session cards
3. **Session Level** (`weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/index.html`) - Session overview with topic grid
4. **Topic Level** (`weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/topic[N].html`) - Individual lesson content

## Content Management

### Adding New Content

#### For New Topics Within Existing Sessions
1. Create new topic file: `weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/topic[X].html`
2. Copy template structure from existing topic files
3. Update session index page to include new topic card
4. Update navigation links in adjacent topics
5. Follow component class conventions for content structure

#### For New Sessions
1. Create session directory: `weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/`
2. Create session index page with topic grid layout
3. Create individual topic files within session directory
4. Update week overview page to include new session card
5. Maintain proper breadcrumb and navigation structure

#### For New Weeks
1. Create week directory: `weeks/week[N]/`
2. Add week overview page using existing week templates
3. Update main course navigation in `index.html`
4. Create session subdirectories following naming conventions
5. Maintain consistent URL and linking structure

## AI Agent Implementation Instructions

### When Building Course Websites from Markdown

#### Step 1: Parse Markdown Files
1. Read all provided markdown files
2. Extract structured information:
   - Week number and title
   - Learning objectives (bullet points)
   - Lecture sessions (titles, topics, durations)
   - Hands-on activities
   - Project details and deliverables
   - Resources and links
3. Organize data into a structured format

#### Step 2: Design Philosophy
Follow Cyber Academic aesthetic direction:
- **Neon accents, dark theme, futuristic yet professional**
- **Typography**: Space Mono (display) + Inter Display (body)
- **Color Scheme**: Use established CSS variables
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, scroll triggers
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach
- **Semantic**: HTML5 elements

#### Step 3: Website Structure Options

**For Single-Page Implementation:**
1. **Hero Section** - Course title, stats, CTA
2. **Overview Section** - Description, highlights, timeline
3. **Curriculum Section** - Expandable week cards/accordions
4. **Features Section** - Learning approach, time commitment
5. **Footer** - Course info, contact, resources

**For Multi-Page Implementation (Current Architecture):**
- **Main Hub** (`index.html`) - Course overview with week cards
- **Week Pages** (`weeks/week[N]/index.html`) - Week overviews with session cards  
- **Session Hubs** (`weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/index.html`) - Session overviews with topic navigation
- **Topic Pages** (`weeks/week[N]/session[N]-[N]/topic[N].html`) - Individual lesson content
- **Project Pages** (`weeks/week[N]/project.html`) - Project guides

#### Step 4: Content Integration Algorithm

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for processing markdown to HTML
function processMarkdownToHTML(weekMdFile) {
    const weekData = {
        number: extractWeekNumber(weekMdFile),
        title: extractTitle(weekMdFile),
        objectives: extractObjectives(weekMdFile),
        lecture1: extractLecture(weekMdFile, 1),
        lecture2: extractLecture(weekMdFile, 2),
        activities: extractActivities(weekMdFile),
        project: extractProject(weekMdFile),
        resources: extractResources(weekMdFile)
    };
    return generateWeekCard(weekData);
}
```

#### Step 5: Markdown Parsing Patterns

Recognize these patterns and convert appropriately:
```markdown
# Week 1: Title → <h2> for week titles
## Learning Objectives → <h3> for section headers
### Topics Covered → <h4> for subsections
- [ ] Deliverable → <input type="checkbox"> for deliverables
[text](url) → <a href="url">text</a>
**bold** → <strong>bold</strong>
`code` → <code>code</code>
```

#### Step 6: Quality Checklist
