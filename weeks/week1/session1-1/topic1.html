                    <p>"Welcome everyone to our first session! I'm excited to embark on this 6-week journey with you into the fascinating world of AI. Whether you're here because you're curious about AI, want to change careers, or just want to understand the technology shaping our world - you're in the right place.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, we're starting with the fundamental question: What exactly is AI? You've probably heard the term everywhere - in news, movies, social media. But what does it really mean? Let's demystify this together."</p>

                    <h4>Slide 1: What is AI?</h4>
                    <code>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence 
processes by machines, especially computer systems.

Key abilities:
• Learning from experience
• Understanding language
• Recognizing patterns
• Solving problems
• Making decisions</code>
                </div>

                <div class="instructor-script">
                    <p>"At its core, AI is about creating machines that can do things that typically require human intelligence. Think about what makes you intelligent - you can learn from mistakes, understand what people say to you, recognize your friend's face in a crowd, solve puzzles, and make decisions. AI aims to give these same capabilities to computers.</p>

                    <p>But here's the key insight: AI doesn't necessarily work the same way our brains do. Just like airplanes fly but don't flap wings like birds, AI systems achieve intelligence through different mechanisms than biological brains.</p>

                    <p>Let me give you a simple analogy: Imagine teaching a child to identify cats. You'd show them many cats, point out features - whiskers, pointy ears, tail - and eventually they learn. AI works similarly! We show computers thousands of cat images, and they learn to identify patterns that make something a 'cat.'"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="interactive-element">
                    <p><strong>Quick thought experiment:</strong> Think of something intelligent you did today. Maybe you recognized a song, decided what to eat, or solved a work problem. Could a computer do that? Keep that in mind as we continue.</p>

                    <h4>Slide 2: Types of AI</h4>
                    <code>Three Levels of AI:

1. Narrow AI (Weak AI) - Current Reality
   • Designed for specific tasks
   • Cannot transfer knowledge between tasks
   • Examples: Siri, Chess AI, Netflix recommendations

2. General AI (Strong AI) - Future Goal
   • Human-like intelligence across domains
   • Can learn and transfer knowledge
   • Doesn't exist yet

3. Super AI - Science Fiction
   • Surpasses human intelligence
   • Theoretical concept
   • Subject of much debate</code>
                </div>

                <div class="instructor-script">
                    <p>"Let's break down the different types of AI, because not all AI is created equal.</p>

                    <p><strong>Narrow AI - This is what we have today:</strong><br>
                    Narrow AI is like a specialist doctor. A cardiologist is amazing at heart problems but doesn't do brain surgery. Similarly, the AI in your smartphone can recognize your face brilliantly, but it can't drive your car or diagnose diseases. Each AI system excels at ONE specific task.</p>

                    <p>Examples you interact with daily:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Spotify's recommendation system</strong> - Amazing at suggesting music, terrible at recognizing images</li>
                        <li><strong>Google Translate</strong> - Excellent at translation, can't play chess</li>
                        <li><strong>Tesla Autopilot</strong> - Great at driving, but can't write emails for you</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Every AI system you've ever used is Narrow AI. And that's what we'll be building in this course!</p>

                    <p><strong>General AI - The Holy Grail:</strong><br>
                    This is what movies show us - AI that can do anything a human can. An AI that could ace a math test, then paint a masterpiece, then diagnose a patient, then write a novel. We're not there yet. Not even close. This is decades away, if not longer.</p>

                    <p>Think of it like this: Right now, we can build amazing specialist AI 'employees,' but we can't build a generalist 'human' AI yet.</p>

                    <p><strong>Super AI - Science Fiction Territory:</strong><br>
                    This is AI that's smarter than humans in every way. This is what people worry about in sci-fi movies. It's purely theoretical and we're SO far from this that most AI researchers don't even think about it in their day-to-day work."</p>

Healthcare:
• Disease diagnosis from medical images
• Drug discovery and development
• Personalized treatment plans

Finance:
• Fraud detection
• Algorithmic trading
• Credit scoring

Transportation:
• Self-driving vehicles
• Route optimization
• Traffic prediction

                    <p>"Let's ground this in reality. Where is AI actually being used today? Everywhere! Let me walk you through some industries:</p>

                    <p><strong>Healthcare - Saving Lives:</strong><br>
                    AI can now detect certain types of cancer from medical scans as accurately as experienced radiologists - sometimes even better! Companies like Google Health have developed AI that can spot diabetic retinopathy (eye disease) from retinal scans. This is huge for developing countries where specialists are scarce.</p>

                    <p><strong>Finance - Protecting Your Money:</strong><br>
                    Every time you swipe your credit card, AI is working in the background. It's analyzing: 'Is this transaction normal for this person?' If you suddenly make a purchase in another country, AI flags it. Banks block billions in fraud every year thanks to AI.</p>

                    <p><strong>Your Daily Life - The Invisible AI:</strong><br>
                    Let's get personal. How many of you:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Have used Face ID to unlock your phone? → AI</li>
                        <li>Asked Siri or Alexa a question? → AI</li>
                        <li>Watched Netflix recommendations? → AI</li>
                        <li>Used Google Maps for directions? → AI</li>

                    <p>You're already living with AI every single day!"</p>

                <div class="highlight-box info">
                    <h4>Real Example Deep Dive</h4>
                    <p>"Let me share a powerful story: In 2019, an AI system called GPT-3 was able to write articles so convincing that people couldn't tell they were written by a machine. By 2023, systems like ChatGPT and Claude (yes, developed by my team at Anthropic!) can have natural conversations, write code, analyze data, and assist with creative work.</p>
                    
                    <p>But remember - these are still Narrow AI. ChatGPT can't drive a car. Tesla's self-driving AI can't write essays. Each is specialized."</p>

                    <p>AI is incredibly good at certain things - often better than humans:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Recognizing objects in images? AI wins.</li>

                        <li>Translating languages? AI is remarkably good.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But AI still struggles with things a five-year-old finds easy:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Understanding that ice cream melts when it's hot (common sense)</li>
                        <li>Folding laundry (physical dexterity)</li>
                        <li>Knowing when a joke is appropriate (social context)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The next 5-10 years? We'll see:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>AI becoming truly conversational partners</li>
                        <li>AI helping scientists make breakthroughs faster</li>
                        <li>AI assistants that understand YOUR specific needs and context</li>
                        <li>More trustworthy and explainable AI</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But we're still far from General AI. And that's okay! Narrow AI is already transforming the world."</p>

                    <div class="qa-answer">A: "Not at all! While AI has math underneath, we'll build intuition first. You can understand HOW a car works without being a mechanical engineer. Same with AI - we'll give you the practical knowledge to build and use AI effectively."</div>
